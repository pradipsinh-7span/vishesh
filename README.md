# **Vishesh** - The rapid design system for your next project ✌

> Unlease the true potential of your project with _VISHESH_, where confidence meets **boldness** in design. <br>

<br><br>

## The Why❓

Developers love ready-made solutions. They use it carelessly which result in a Mediocre design system and UIUX. <br>
Neglecting thoughtful design decisions and blindly relying on ready-made solutions can lead to a lack of visual aesthetic and poor maintainability.<br>
It is crucial to balance customization with best practices, ensuring proper hierarchy, semantic markup, and responsive design.<br><br>

### _Vishesh addresses the lack of passion and vision in web development.<br>So, developers can focus on delivery while effortlessly achieving a high-quality design system._ <br>
