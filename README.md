# **Vishesh** - The rapid design system for your web project ✌

### Unlease the true potential of your project with _VISHESH_, where confidence meets boldness in design. <br>

<br><br>

## The Why❓

Developers love readymade solutions. They use it carelessly which result in a Mediocore design system and UIUX. <br>
Neglecting thoughtful design decisions and blindly relying on readymade solutions can lead to a lack of visual aesthetic and poor maintainability.<br>
It is crucial to balance customization with best practices, ensuring proper hierarchy, semantic markup, and responsive design.<br><br>

### _Vishesh addresses the lack of passion and vision in web development.<br>So, developers can focus on functionality while effortlessly achieving a high-quality design system._ <br>
