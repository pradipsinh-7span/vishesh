# Vishesh Configs

Our curated collection of default styles and configurations, which includes TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and other predefined settings, lays the foundation for a smooth and efficient development experience, guaranteeing both consistency and high-quality code.

### Why Do We Need Such Configurations?

  <summary>Early Error Detection</summary>
  TypeScript and ESLint catch potential errors during development, reducing debugging
  time and ensuring code correctness. These tools provide developers with invaluable
  feedback, leading to a more robust codebase.

<details>
  <summary>Code Consistency</summary>
  With predefined configurations, we enforce consistent coding styles across projects.
  This consistency enhances code readability and collaboration within teams, leading
  to more maintainable and scalable applications.

  <summary>Code Formatting</summary>
  Prettier automatically formats your code, eliminating the need for manual formatting
  and reducing code review distractions. It guarantees a uniform and polished codebase
  without the hassle.
