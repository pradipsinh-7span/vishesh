Our curated collection of default styles and configurations, including TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and other predefined configs, sets the stage for a seamless and efficient development journey.

### Why Do We Need Such Configurations?

ðŸ‘‰ **Code Consistency** <br />
With predefined configurations, we enforce consistent coding styles across projects. This consistency enhances code readability and collaboration within teams, leading to more maintainable and scalable applications.

ðŸ‘‰ **Early Error Detection** <br />
TypeScript and ESLint catch potential errors during development, reducing debugging time and ensuring code correctness. These tools provide developers with invaluable feedback, leading to a more robust codebase.

ðŸ‘‰ **Code Formatting** <br />
Prettier automatically formats your code, eliminating the need for manual formatting and reducing code review distractions. It guarantees a uniform and polished codebase without the hassle.
