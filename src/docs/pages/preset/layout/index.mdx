# Layout

Layout is like arranging puzzle pieces on a board. Layout decides where things go, how they line up, and how much space is around them.

Imagine setting up a room â€“ where you put the sofa, the TV, and the plants. Similarly, in web design, layout decides where text, images, buttons, content and other things go.

A good layout makes it easy for people to understand and use a website, making it look nice and work well. It's like making sure everything is in the right place to tell a clear and attractive story.
