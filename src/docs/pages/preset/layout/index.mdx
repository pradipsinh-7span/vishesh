# Layout

Layout is like arranging puzzle pieces on a board. It's how we place things like text, pictures, buttons, and more on a webpage or design. Layout decides where things go, how they line up, and how much space is around them. Imagine setting up a room â€“ where you put the sofa, the TV, and the plants. Similarly, in web design, layout decides where menus, pictures, and content go. A good layout makes it easy for people to understand and use a website, making it look nice and work well. It's like making sure everything is in the right place to tell a clear and attractive story.
