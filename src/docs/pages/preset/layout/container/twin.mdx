# Twin Container

If you choose _Fixed_ or _Fluid_ container then, you can use only one of them in your project. But, what if you want to use both of them together?

Introducing the _Twin container_ with a little change in class names and few rules.

<Callout type="info">
  <em>You can use fixed and fluid container</em>
  <em> configurations normally as you use</em>
  <em> when container type is fixed or fluid</em>
  <em> except there are some changes mentioned below</em>
</Callout>

<br />

## Spacing

`#1` spacing applies to both container. if you want to override it for _Fixed_ or _Fluid_ container then, you can do it by adding object with the container type key (`#2` and `#3`).

```js
container: {
  type: "twin",
  // ...
  spacing: {
    "breakpoint key": number,     // #1
    fixed: {
      "breakpoint key": number,   // #2
    },
    fluid: {
      "breakpoint key": number,   // #3
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  <em>fixed and fluid objects are optional</em>
</Callout>

<br />

## Class names

### Auto

For auto class there is no change in name.

1. `container-fixed`
2. `container-fluid`

### Manual

For manual classes, you have to explicitly add container type in class name to identify which container you are using.

| Type  | Before       | After                |
| :---- | :----------- | :------------------- |
| Fixed | container    | container-fixed-base |
|       | container-sm | container-fixed-sm   |
|       | container-md | container-fixed-md   |
|       | // ...       | and so on            |
| Fluid | container    | container-fluid-base |
|       | container-sm | container-fluid-sm   |
|       | container-md | container-fluid-md   |
|       | // ...       | and so on            |

> <em>If center is set to false</em>

| Type  | Before           | After                  |
| :---- | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| Fixed | container-left   | container-fixed-left   |
|       | container-center | container-fixed-center |
|       | container-right  | container-fixed-right  |

```

### Manual

```js

```

> <em>manually set horizontal padding at a specific breakpoint</em>

```js
class="container-fluid-base container-fluid-md"
