## Why?

Developers love ready-made solutions. They often use them carelessly, which can result in a mediocre design system and UI/UX. Neglecting thoughtful
design decisions and blindly relying on ready-made solutions can lead to
a lack of visual aesthetic and poor maintainability.

It is crucial to balance customization with best practices, ensuring
proper hierarchy, semantic markup, and responsive design.
